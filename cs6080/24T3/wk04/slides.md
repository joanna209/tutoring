## Creating an element



---

## Demo

Write a function `createTree` that creates a nested ul/li list from the nested object.

Each category should be interactive ie clicking on the parent `<li>` should hide/reveal its children list

---

The following nested object

```js
let data = {
  Food: {
    Fruits: {
      apple: {},
      banana: {},
    },
  },

  Drinks: {
    Hot: {
      coffee: {},
      tea: {},
    },
    Cold: {
      juice: {},
      soda: {},
    },
  },
};
```

---

The object should look something like this
