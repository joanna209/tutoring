## Any questions?

---
## Now onto frontend programming....

---
## HTML

HTML: Hypertext markup language

Defines the structure and content of a webpage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> 
<!-- structure of the webpage -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<!-- content of a webpage -->
<body>
    <h1>hello</h1>
    <!-- remember to include alt tags for better accessibility -->
    <img src="hi.png" alt="image of the word hi"/>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## CSS

CSS: Cascading style sheets

Adds styling to a webpage

```css
body { /* selector that matches the body HTML element */
    /* property: value */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}
```

---

## Ok... but how do I add styling?

- Inline CSS

```html
<h1 style="color:orange">hi</h1>
```

---

## We can one up this...

- Add internal css in the style tag of your HTML document
```html
<head>
    <!-- your head tags here... -->
    <style>
        h1 { /* this changes the styles for all h1 tags */
            color: orange;
        }

        .hi {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

---

- Use a separate css file and import via the link tag

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- other head properties... -->
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- styles from mystyle.css will be applied to the document -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
</html>
```

```css
/* in mystyle.css */
h1 {
    color: orange;
}
```

## So.... why's my CSS property not working?

---

## CSS Cascading

The CSS cascade allows our browsers resolve competing CSS declarations by:
1. Importance
2. Origin
3. Specificity
4. Position

---

## Importance

- Active animations / transitions
- Adding `!important` to the end of CSS declaration (use as last resort as it is limited in flexibility)
    - i.e. 
    ```css
    p {
        color: orchid !important;
    }
    ```
- Normal rules

---

## Origin

- Website - where we apply CSS styling
- User
- Browser - each browser comes with its own set of styles

---

## Specificity

The specificity of our css rules matter (with inline being most specific)

- Inline e.g. `<h1 style="colour:blue">`
- Layer (ignore this)
- Id e.g. `#id`
- Class | attribute | pseudoclass e.g. `.class`, `[checked]` or `:hover`
- type | pseudo-element e.g. `p` or `:before`

---

## Position

- Rules that are defined later in CSS spreadsheets or `<style>` tags will be resolved first, if everything else in the cascade is the same

```css
p {
  color: sandybrown;
  color: orchid; /* the text will be orchid */
}
```

---

## We can also position elements using box model

- Margin: spacing outside of the element
- Padding: spacing inside of the element

![Demo](assets/boxmodel.png)

---

## Flexbox

- One-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns

![Flexbox](assets/flexbox.png)

---

```css
.wrapper {
    /* apply flexbox */
    display: flex;
    /* tell the element to arrange its child elements in a column format */
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

---

## Grid layout

- Two-dimensional layout method for arranging items in multiple rows and columns

![Grid](assets/grid.png)

---

```css
.wrapper {
    /* apply grid layout to child elements */
    display: grid;
    /* create 3 columns with a minimum size of 10px and can expand based on content */
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(10px, 1fr));
    gap: 10px;
    /* create rows with a minimum size of 100px and can expand based on content */
    grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
}
```

## Demo

Let's recreate the Apple Health dashboard with HTML/CSS!


For bigger screen sizes (i.e. above 1000px)
