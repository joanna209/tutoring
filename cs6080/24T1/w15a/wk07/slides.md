## What is accessibility ‚ùì‚ùì

---

## From [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility)

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible

---

## Benefits of accessibile design

- Having semantic HTML improves SEO
- Demonstrates good ethics & morals
- Ensures your application is usable for everyone
- Apart of the law in some places

---

## Measuring accessibility

Your application should *aim* to abide by these 4 principles from WCAG to be considered as accessible

---

| Principle  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Perceivable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable)  | Users must be able to perceive it in some way, using one or more of their senses  |
| [Operable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Operable)  | Users must be able to control UI elements  |
| [Understandable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Understandable) | The content must be understandable to its users |
| [Robust](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Robust)  | The content must be developed using well-adopted web standards that will work across different browsers, now and in the future  |

---

## Implementing accessibility

Some ideas (not an exhaustive list):
- Use semantic HTML
- Use meaningful attributes for input and label fields
- Use meaningful alt attributes for images
- Ensure elements have adequate colour contrast

---

## Demo

Let's review some code snippets and see how we can improve the  overall accessibility of each code snippet

---

## Demo (1/3)

Refactor the starter HTML code to improve accessibility

The final result should look something like this:
